<!-- What's Happening here? -->
<!-- 
=>We are trying to create front end of our app using React.
=> React acts a middleman for Manipulating DOM rather than us having to manually do it they way we do it in vanilla Javascript
=> We have added CDN of React here in order to get functionality of the React without having to install anything as of yet.
=> in our "script.js" we have selected our HTML's root element by id to make it root and then in that root we have rendered a H1

How do we run this?
 => I simply run a server using python3 -m htttp.server <portName>.
=> or you can simply open index.html in your browser.
